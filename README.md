# What is CryptPy?


CryptPy - Python Message Encrypter/Decrypter.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
### Overview
CryptPy is a program written in Python to encrypt any messages and also decrypt the messages.
### Get the Code

```
$ git clone https://github.com/CodeDroid999/Cryptpy.git

```

### Installing
1.You will first need to have Python installed and to make sure that you have added Python to PATH.
Extract the folder to somewhere easily accessible.
You should have a folder containing the following files:
<ol>
  <li>crytpPy.py</li>
  <li>keys.png</li>
  <li>requirements.txt</li>
</ol>
2.Once you have a command prompt open to the correct path, you should type the following command:
     py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
(to run the program successfully, we need a python module called pybase64 installed: running the above command installs it for you)
Alternatively:
you can run : pip install pybase64

If you have pybase64 installed,ther is no need to run the command.
To run CryptPy, open your CMD and type "Crypt.py", then press enter:


The app gets the password typed by the user and compares it with 1234: (secret key for this program)-you can change it in the code to your liking.
