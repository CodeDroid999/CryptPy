Installing
You will first need to have Python installed and to make sure that you have added Python to PATH.
Extract the folder to somewhere easily accessible.
You should have a folder containing the following files:
<ol>
<li>crytpPy.py<li>
<li>keys.png<li>
<li>requirements.txt<li>
<ol>
Once you have a command prompt open to the correct path, you should type the following command:
     py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
(to run the program successfully, we need a python module called pybase64 installed: running the above command installs it for you)

you can run : pip install pybase64

If you have pybase64 installed,ther is no need to run the command.
